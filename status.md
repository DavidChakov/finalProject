Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created a player and enemy that shoots projectiles in a rotating pattern. Detects if the player gets hit by the projectile, though does not yet do anyth8ing with that information.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Currently working on an enemy that shoots projectiles that track the player. Would like to design pixel art and add a timer and hit points.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Struggling to figure out the code to create tracking projectiles. Will need to mess around more. No major problems.
